      Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But when
      you’re in the flow, it’s incredibly rewarding.
    </h3>
    <p>
      We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force
      behind Ableton is our passion for what we make, and the people we make it
      for.

      We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between
      our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use
      Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and
      professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught, and
      most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief
      that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something
      big: helping to shape the future of music culture.

      We believe it takes focus to create truly outstanding instruments. We only
      work on a few products and we strive to make them great.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people
      what they need to work their magic and grow. We’ve learned that achieving
      the best results comes from building teams that are richly diverse, and
      thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t
      always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly
      encouraged.

      We’re passionate about what we do, but we’re equally passionate about
      improving who we are.

    <p>
      We work hard to foster an environment where people can grow both
      personally and professionally, and we strive to create a wealth of
      opportunities to learn from and with each other.

      Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported
      in acquiring new knowledge and skills, and coached on applying these in
      their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development and music
      salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and
      best practices.

      If you're joining us in Berlin, we'll help with relocation and paperwork.
      We’ll even provide you with free German or English lessons. Plus, working
      in Germany means you can expect comprehensive health insurance for you and
      your family, as well as generous maternity and paternity leave. Office
      hours are flexible, but it’s not all work; we have several company and
      team outings throughout the year as well as a variety of fun, informal
      small-group activities.
