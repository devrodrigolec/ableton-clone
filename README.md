# Ableton Page Clone

In this project, I have created a clone of the 'about' section of the Ableton website. To complete this project, I have used Vite, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I remain open to any feedback you can provide to help me continue improving.

- Original Web: https://www.ableton.com/en/about/
- Live Project View: https://rodrigo-clone-ableton.netlify.app/

To run the project locally, you should use the following commands:

- npm install
- npm run dev
